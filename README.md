# GitGenie ðŸ’¡
A tool to allow anyone to search for repos created by a user or organisation

# Features! ðŸ’»

  [x] Responsive mobile design 
  [x] Uses React on the front end (create-react-app), with Hooks!
  [x] Uses Express on the backend
  [x] Makes github API calls via backend server
  [x] Validation
    
  # ToDo's ðŸ”§
  [ ] Write Tests
  [ ] Error Handling UI - (so far the code catches errors but UI not built)
  [ ] Improve design
  [ ] Fix bugs
  [ ] Allow filtered searches (eg repos made in the last 7 days)
  

 # Key Learning Takeaway's ðŸ“š
 Thank you for giving me this project. I spent a few hours each day over about 5 days to build it. I am grateful because..
  - I had never used React's Hooks before. I spent most of the time learning how to use them, and I am happy that I now feel confident using Hooks. I figured that because I want to learn React Native, why not start now and implement hooks! Hooks are very fun once you learn to adapt your thinking. 
  - I really enjoy design. I loved coming up wirth the idea of a git Genie , and playing on this theme.  I want to become a design pro.
  - I want to learn about best practises for Hooks. I played around with having several state hooks versus a single object, and I am unsure of the best way. Also, balance between component splitting is key. I sometimes overdid component splitting; which is great for writing tests and reusable UI, but perhaps not necessary for a small project. 

### Tech

GitGenie uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Styled Components] - Makes it easy to style with JavaScript in React!
* [Node Fetch] - awesome node based Fetch API

### Installation
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd git-genie
$ npm i
$ npm start
```
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
